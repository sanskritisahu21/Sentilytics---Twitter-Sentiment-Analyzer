📊 Sentilytics - Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

🧠 About the Project

Sentilytics is a sentiment analysis project that demonstrates how to build a machine learning model using Python to analyze Twitter data. The primary goal is to determine public sentiment—positive, negative, or neutral—towards Pfizer vaccines based on tweet content.

Twitter sentiment analysis is a powerful tool used to understand public opinion and social dynamics around trending topics, brands, or events. In this project, we leverage a labeled dataset from Kaggle and apply machine learning techniques to draw meaningful insights from raw tweets.

🔍 Features

1. Preprocessing of raw tweet data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

2. Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)

3. Sentiment prediction: Positive, Negative, or Neutral

4. Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

5. Visualization of sentiment distribution

🛠️ Technologies Used

1. Python

2. Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

3. Natural Language Processing

4. Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle:
