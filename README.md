# 📊 Sentilytics - Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

## 🧠 About the Project

**Sentilytics** is a sentiment analysis project that demonstrates how to build a machine learning model using Python to analyze Twitter data. The primary goal is to determine public sentiment—positive, negative, or neutral—towards **Pfizer vaccines** based on tweet content.

Twitter sentiment analysis is a powerful tool used to understand public opinion and social dynamics around trending topics, brands, or events. In this project, we leverage a labeled dataset from Kaggle and apply machine learning techniques to draw meaningful insights from raw tweets.

## 🔍 Features

* Preprocessing of raw tweet data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
* Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
* Sentiment prediction: Positive, Negative, or Neutral
* Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
* Visualization of sentiment distribution

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation
* Natural Language Processing
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle:
🔗 [Pfizer Vaccine Sentiment Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

The dataset contains:

* Tweet content
* Timestamp
* Sentiment label (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
